# Portfolio-Website
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio, designed to showcase my web development skills and projects. The site is responsive and was built using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and the Bootstrap framework. It includes sections about me, my projects, technical skills, and a contact area.
